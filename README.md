#	IRDiscreteLayoutManager

Evadne Wu at Iridia Productions, 2011.

The discrete layout manager is an experimental layout manager for providing information that can be used to display discrete layotu objects on an iPad.  Although theoretically it might also work on an iPhone, the limited display size makes it somewhat impractical.

This project is under heavy progress and should not be used in production yet.
