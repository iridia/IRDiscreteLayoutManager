//	The Transforming additions to the layout grid allows relationships between two layout grid prototypes
//	As long as the two grid prototypes have fully fulfilled their layout area relationships, things will be fine

//	For example, if a prototype of 1024 by 768 and another prototype of 768 by 1024 have fully registered relationships
//	via [IRDiscreteLayoutGrid markAreaNamed:inGridPrototype:asEquivalentToAreaNamed:inGridPrototype:]
//	then during autorotation a newly filled grid can be substituted for landscape / portrait
